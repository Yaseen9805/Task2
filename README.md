Overview
In this task, I styled the profile page using external CSS to understand how presentation is separated from structure. The focus was on global styles, the CSS box model, reusable classes, and clean styling practices.

What I Did
Created a separate Task2.css file and linked it to the HTML using the tags.
Applied global styles such as font family, text color, background color, and line height to understand cascading behavior.
Used the CSS box model (margin, padding, border) to control spacing and layout.
Styled headings, paragraphs, lists, and navigation to improve readability and visual hierarchy.
Used borders temporarily on sections to clearly visualize padding and margin during development.
Used class-based styling (like a reusable spacing class) instead of inline styles.
Refactored repeated styles into reusable classes to keep the CSS clean and maintainable.
Used browser developer tools to inspect elements and adjust spacing live.

What I Learned
How CSS cascades and how global vs specific styles work.
How the box model affects layout and spacing.
Why reusable classes and external CSS are important for scalable projects.
How to debug and understand layouts using browser developer tools.
